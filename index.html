    <h1 class="h1">My Favorite Holiday Highlight</h1>
    <p>My holiday this year was pretty different and unexpected. I got to spend it with the love of my
       life. My last year self would definitely be in shock if she'd find out that I actually spent
       Christmas with someone, other than family members.
    </p>

    <p>Me and Antonio spent the 26th of December together. We went to Evia Lifestyle Center. We spent
       a good amount of time there, just the two of us. We didn't get to spend the actual Christmas 
       date together since both of our families got different errands to do.
    </p>

    <p>We went to almost every store there is, walking around while holding hands, just enjoying each other's
       company. 
    </p>

    <p>I can be myself when i'm with him. As cheesy as it sounds, but it's true. Whenever i'm with Antonio, I 
       don't have to worry on whether I do this, or that, or act like this, or that. And that's one of the things
       I love the most. If I were to share the first on the things that I love, he would be on the first. 
       During festive times like these, it's only right for us to spend it with the people we love. That is 
       the real purpose of it anyway. So yeah, that sums up my favorite highlight of my holiday.
